# Norwegian Shouldly

A Norwegian language wrapper for the [Shouldly assertion framework](https://github.com/shouldly/shouldly). This wrapper contains no additional or changed functionality, it just translates english function- and parameter names into Norwegian for a more fluent experience when coding in Norwegian.
